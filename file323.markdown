## 13th of July Diary
I heard an interesting thing today and it made me reconsider my relationships, so from now on I won't be attached to anyone, I will be living my life and doing my best whatever happened.
and I set some rules for myself which are:
1. work every day.
  * chase my **goals**
  * watch out for my _health_.
3. be *better* than yesterday.
4. be __nice__ to people.
